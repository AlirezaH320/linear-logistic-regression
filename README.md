# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is one of the most basic and important techniques for predicting a
value of an attribute (y). e.g. price of a house, number of people employed based on
some factors. It is used to fit values in a forecasting or predictive model. The
attributes are usually fitted using the least squares approach. The cost function which it
involves for minimizing the error can be minimized using many mathematical tricks and
algorithms (Gradient Descent, Derivative test, Newton's Method). Using the derivative
method on the least squares approach and with the help of properties of matrices, it
reduces the problem of linear regression to a consolidated equation.
# Logistic Regression
whilst linear regression is used to predict or forecast a value, logistic
regression, which can also be interpreted as a perceptron, is used to classify
between two distinct classes. Logistic Regression is one of the most popular
and most widely used learning algorithms.
The value predicted by logistic regression is a discrete value. Here are some
examples of classification problems:
Email: Spam / Not Spam
Online Transactions: Fraudulent / Legitimate
Tumor: Malignant / Benign
In all of these examples, the value that we are trying to predict is a variable Y
that we can think of as taking on two values, either zero or one (Zero =
negative class, One = Positive class).
